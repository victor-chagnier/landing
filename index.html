    <h2>1. Where do you want to surf?</h2>
  		 <p> "The ocean doesn't vibrate. It rises like a straight, steep or peak-shaped wall, reaching a height of about twenty metres. When the wave rises, it is too late. "By referring to these "pirate waves" that frighten sailors so much, Schiffter points to one of the fears inherent in surfing, which some, more experienced, manage to overcome. It is that of the unpredictable, the unknown, the spontaneity of the waves that are born before us and show that we are nothing.</p>
